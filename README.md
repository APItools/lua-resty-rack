# lua-resty-rack

A simple and extensible HTTP server framework for [OpenResty](http://openresty.org), providing a clean method for loading Lua HTTP applications ("resty" modules) into [Nginx](http://nginx.org).

Drawing inspiration from [Rack](http://rack.github.com/) and also [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect), **lua-resty-rack** allows you to load your application as a piece of middleware, alongside other middleware. Your application can either; ignore the current request, modify the request or response in some way and pass on to other middleware, or take responsibiliy for the request by generating a response.

## Status

This library is considered experimental and the API may change without notice. Please feel free to offer suggestions or raise issues here on Github.

## Installation

Copy the `rack.lua` file inside your nginx's `lib` folder and make sure it is included in the `lua_package_path` variable in `nginx.conf`.

## Using Middleware

To install middleware for a given `location`, you simply call `rack.use(middleware)` in the order you wish the modules to run, and then finally call `rack.run()`.

```nginx
server {
  location / {
    content_by_lua '
      local rack = require "rack"

      rack.use(require "my.middleware")
      rack.run()
    ';
  }
}
```

### `rack.use(middleware, ...)`

The `middleware` parameter must be a callable object (usually a Lua function).

The function should accept at least two params:`req` and `res`.

```lua
rack.use(function(req, res)
  res.header["X-Homer"] = "Doh!"
end)
```
Any extra arguments passed to `rack.use` will be passed to the middleware after `req` and `res`.

```lua
local body_replacer = function(req,res,from,to)
  res.body = res.body:gsub(from, to)
end

rack.use(function(req, res)
  res.status = 200
  res.body   = "I like Chocolate"
end)

rack.use(body_replacer, "Chocolate", "Vanilla")
```

It's possible to chain more than one middleware by calling `rack.use` several times.
The middlewares will be executed in the same order they are included by `rack.use`. They can
modify `req` and `res` by changing their properties or adding new ones. It is required that
at least `res.status` is set by some middleware.

### `rack.run()`

Runs each of the middlewares in order, until the list is finished or one of the middlewares stops the pipeline (see below).

Middlewares will be executed in the same order as they were included by `rack.use()`.

Each middleware can make modifications to `req` and `res`, and the next middleware will receive them. The `options` parameter
is optional and will be the same one provided in `rack.use`.

The middleware pipeline can be halted by any middleware who whishes to do so, by returning `false`. At that moment, nginx will
just use the current contents of `res` as the final result.

Note that `res.status` is mandatory. Attempting to halt the pipeline without setting it will result in an error. If `res.status`
is "valid" (for example, 200), then `res.body` must be set to a non-empty string.

## `res` attributes

### `res.status`

The HTTP status code to return.
There are [constants defined](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpLuaModule#HTTP_status_constants) for common statuses.
This value *must* be set by at least one middleware, otherwise the execution of `rack.run` will result in an error.

### `res.header`

A table containing the request headers. Keys are matched case insensitvely, and optionally with underscores instead of hyphens. e.g.

```lua
req.header["X-Foo"] = "bar"
res.body = req.header.x_foo --> "bar"
```

### `res.body`

The response body. It's initially empty, and will be returned by nginx as response after the last middleware in the chain has been executed.

## `req` attributes

### `req.method`

The HTTP method, e.g. `GET`, set from `ngx.var.request_method`.

### `req.scheme`

The protocol scheme `http|https`, set from `ngx.var.scheme`.

### `req.uri`

e.g. `/my/uri`, set from `ngx.var.uri`.

### `req.host`

The hostname, e.g. `example.com`, set from `ngx.var.host`.

### `req.query`

The querystring, e.g. `var1=1&var2=2`, set from `ngx.var.query_string`.

### `req.args`

The query args, as a `table`, set from `ngx.req.get_uri_args()`.

### `req.header`

A table of headers. Just like in `res.header`, keys are normalized before being matched.

### `req.body`

The request body. It's loaded automatically (via metatables) the first time it's requested, since it's an expensive operation. Then it is
cached. It can also be set to anything else by any middleware.
